## Particle System for the pixi.js rendering framework

### Goal

The goal of this libray is to provide a flexible and powerful framework to create awesome particle systems
without much thought. It should provide extensibility for customization and ease to implement new features
if the use case requires it.


### Roadmap

* [X] Basic particle functionality
* [/] Particle manipulators (Forces, Wells, Events)
* [ ] Shaded particles (Vertex, Fragment)
* [ ] Spine based particles (Allow spine animations on particles)
* [ ] Publish to npm
